# The Problem

Most of the large dropshippers have already found profitable funnels that run on razor thin margins in most mainstream niches. This means your average new dropshipper has to venture out there to find products and keywords that sell. If you don't target the right niche your dropshipping business might aswell be dead on arrival. This line is very popular within the drop shipping community. 

# The Solution

A tool to compare the trends and the intensity of the engagement of the audiance in the niche that the dropshipper is targetting. Usually this is a very slow and annoying task. Based on personal experience there are a lot of interesting products that can be chained in multiple niches.
Here's a example.

#### Dota 2 crystal madien keychain

Here, Dota 2 is the first niche and Crystal maiden is a popular character within this game. Keychains are something that every person uses and hence this turns out to be a pretty decent niche.

How did we find that out?

Look for a parent niche, Say dogs then go for the sub niche which could be corgi. Now, our scraper has a base and it can look for products for a corgi dog on sites such as ali express.
##### User gives the parent niche scraper looks for subniches unless subniche has been fed by the dropshipper.

Once it finds multiple products such as (Keychains, Lockets, Toys) which are related to a corgi for instance it will then look for data on those products and rank them based on a certian formula which can give the drop shipper the best product to promote with the target audiance.
